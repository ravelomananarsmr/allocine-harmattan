The Debian Package allocine
----------------------------

The goal of this application for MeeGo Harmattan is to access to popular french website AlloCine with a native application. It is somewhat comparable in functionnalities to Android or iPhone applications. The information is accessed through the AlloCine API for wich information can be found here: http://wiki.gromez.fr/dev/api/allocine_v3

Note that this is not an official application, and we are in no way related to AlloCine company.

Application is only available in french as AlloCine is a french service, and the API text returned is in french only. Translating application menus and keeping french content would not make much sense.
